<p><strong><a name="mppe"></a>6. Install MPPE Kernel Module </strong></p>
<p>As the kernel in FC4 does not support MPPE which is required by MSCHAPv2, you will have to add this additional feature to it. You can download the MPPE module builder in rpm format from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44827">here</a>. You will need:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>dkms-2.0.6-1.noarch.rpm
kernel_ppp_mppe-0.0.5-2dkms.noarch.rpm</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Install them with command &quot;rpm -ivh&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[root@pptp ~]# rpm -ivh dkms-2.0.6-1.noarch.rpm
[root@pptp ~]# rpm -ivh kernel_ppp_mppe-0.0.5-2dkms.noarch.rpm </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you upgrade your kernel to 2.6.13, you will have problem with kernel_ppp_mppe-0.0.5-2dkms. The installation goes ok but the pptp tunnel will not connect. You will find error messages &quot;This system lacks kernel support for PPP.&quot; in /var/log/messages.  There is a newer kernel_ppp_mppe from Dell which fixes this problem. The rpm is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://linux.dell.com/files/pptp/kernel_ppp_mppe-1.0.2-1dkms.noarch.rpm">kernel_ppp_mppe-1.0.2-1dkms.noarch.rpm</a></p>
</blockquote>
<dt><strong>Note:</strong></dt>
<dd>(1) apparently MPPE support has gone into the kernel v2.6.12 or above. Not sure the updated FC4 kernel has it or not. At the moment, you will probably have to install MPPE yourself. </dd>
<dd>(2) Fedora Extra provides also a dkms rpm, dkms-2.0.6-3.fc4.noarch.rpm. I have not tested it. You may want to use the one I mentioned above to make sure the installation will work. </dd>

<strong><a name="autoinstaller"></a>6.1 Kernel Upgrade and dkms_autoinstaller</strong>
<p>If you upgrade your kernel after installing dkms, thanks to the dkms_autoinstaller service, you will not have to worry about the dkms kernel module. dkms_autoinstaller runs on every bootup. It checks  the dkms module to ensure it match the kernel version. If a mismatch is found, it will create a proper one for the boot kernel. </p>
<p>For dkms_autoinstaller to work, you will need the correct kernel-devel version installed in your system. It is always a good idea to install the kernel-devel rpm alongside with your new kernel. </p>

<strong><a name="pppd_pptpd" id="pppd_pptpd"></a>7. pppd and  pptpd</strong>
<p><a name="pppd"><strong>7.1 Upgrade pppd </strong></a></p>
<p>FC4 comes with ppp-2.4.2-7. It is required to be upgraded to a patched version which supports MPPE. The patched version can be found in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44827">here</a>. Download the rpm for FC4. At the time of writing, the latest version is 2.4.3-5. Get the FC4 rpm: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ppp-2.4.3-5.fc4.i386.rpm</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Upgrade the ppp with the downloaded version:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[root@pptp ~]# rpm -Uvh ppp-2.4.3-5.fc4.i386.rpm</pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<a name="pptpd"></a><strong>7.2 Install pptpd</strong>
<p>In the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44827">same page</a> download the pptpd rpm, pptpd-1.3.0-0.i386.rpm, and install it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[root@pptp ~]# rpm -ivh pptpd-1.3.0-0.i386.rpm</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: pptpd-1.3 is an experimental version. The stable version is 1.2.3. Both versions work fine for me. It is up to you to choose which one to use. </p>
