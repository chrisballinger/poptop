	FAQ seen on mailing lists.

	* pptpd.conf.5: add routing checklists for three different methods
	of allocating subnets and configuring pptpd.

	speed option to end of list.  Rework text for simplicity.  Cross

	pptpctrl.c, remove examples because running from inetd(8) is

	--ppp option to specify PPP program to use in place of default

	instead of fopen() to verify that files can be read or executed.

	* pptpd.c: bug fix, --stimeout option was not working due to use
	of strdup() and a blind cast instead of atoi().

	* pptpd.c: bug fix, --noipparam option on command line was causing
	premature exit during option processing.

	* pptpctrl.c (pptp_handle_ctrl_connection): on any CALL_CLR_RQST,
	terminate the call.  From: "Bruno Lopes F. Cabral"
	<bruno@openline.com.br> 2004-01-08

Fri Feb 27 09:50:41 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): make sure SIGCHLD is unblocked. The
	procmask gets inherited from the manager and usually has the
	SIGCHLD blocked. Actually pppd does not expect that somebody
	tampered with its signal mask, thus we just unblock all signals
	and leave them to be handled by pppd.  This fixes the "ip-up
	zombie" bug.  From: Peter Stamfest <poptop@stamfest.at> 2003-09-06

	Linux, despite being accepted by pppd.

Wed Dec 10 09:28:01 2003  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): report program binary path.

Tue Dec  9 10:22:01 2003  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): report cause of failed execvp().
	* pptpctrl.c (startCall): better explain launch failure.
