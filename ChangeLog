Mon May 17 12:31:34 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): remove html, as the documentation is
	out of date, explicitly name samples, tools and plugins files to
	prevent CVS in tarball.

Mon May 17 12:31:09 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* debian: merge upstream Debian patches.  From Rene Mayrhofer.

Fri May 14 15:50:35 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpd.c (killbcrelay): bug fix, pptpd catches SIGTERM to kill
	bcrelay, but doesn't kill itself.  "This patch solves partially
	the problem.  When there is a connection established klling the
	main pptpd process will not kill the control connection process."
	From: Pawel Guraj.

Thu Apr 29 20:18:19 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpd.8, pptpd.conf.5: adopt man page review suggestions.

Thu Apr 29 19:49:59 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* plugins/pptpd-logwtmp.c (ip_up): use the username that was
	authenticated from the peer_authname variable rather than the
	local host name hiding in the user variable.
	Reported by: Pawel Guraj.

Thu Apr 29 16:56:05 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* ctrlpacket.c (deal_out_call): print connection speed properly.
	From: Jan Dubiec.

Thu Apr 29 16:49:03 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	bcrelay config option nor --bcrelay command line flag used.  From:
	Jan Dubiec, Pawel Guraj.

Wed Apr 28 21:24:25 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* README.logwtmp: write up new feature to track user connections
	and disconnections using the standard wtmp(5) mechanism.

	* tools/vpnwho.pl: mark as obsolete.

Wed Apr 28 19:54:04 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (main): waitpid() rather than kill() the pppd, so
	that ip-down scripts get executed.

Tue Apr 27 09:11:32 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* NEWS: change attribution on request from author.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): include README.portslave, re-order list.

Sun Apr 25 20:31:52 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpd-1.2.0-b3.tar.gz: released.
	
Sat Apr 24 20:51:54 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpgre.c (decaps_hdlc): add hint for EIO on read() of PTY,
	suggesting a look at option syntax and pppd logs.  To address a
	FAQ seen on mailing lists.

	* pptpd.conf.5: add routing checklists for three different methods
	of allocating subnets and configuring pptpd.

	* pptpd.8, pptpd.conf.5: add noipparam option documentation.  Move
	speed option to end of list.  Rework text for simplicity.  Cross

	--ppp option to specify PPP program to use in place of default
	PPP_BINARY, and pass the new parameter to pptpctrl.  Also reworked
	option handling and validation to simplify code.  Use access()
	instead of fopen() to verify that files can be read or executed.

	* pptpd.c: bug fix, --stimeout option was not working due to use
	of strdup() and a blind cast instead of atoi().

	* pptpd.c: bug fix, --noipparam option on command line was causing
	premature exit during option processing.

Fri Apr 23 21:01:31 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* tools/pptp-portslave: add contribution from Russell Coker, on

	* makepackage: use complete version, including beta release, as

	/usr/local/bin is locally administered; we have no right to warn,

	file there.

	* Anon-CVS-Root: obsolete, removed.
	
	* build.sh: obsolete build.sh

Fri Feb 27 09:53:19 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (pptp_handle_ctrl_connection): on any CALL_CLR_RQST,
	terminate the call.  From: "Bruno Lopes F. Cabral"
	<bruno@openline.com.br> 2004-01-08
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=poptop-server&m=107359240120864&w=2

Fri Feb 27 09:50:41 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): make sure SIGCHLD is unblocked. The
	procmask gets inherited from the manager and usually has the
	SIGCHLD blocked. Actually pppd does not expect that somebody
	tampered with its signal mask, thus we just unblock all signals
	and leave them to be handled by pppd.  This fixes the "ip-up
	zombie" bug.  From: Peter Stamfest <poptop@stamfest.at> 2003-09-06
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=poptop-server&m=106284825408104&w=2

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): report program binary path.

Tue Dec  9 10:22:01 2003  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): report cause of failed execvp().
	* pptpctrl.c (startCall): better explain launch failure.
