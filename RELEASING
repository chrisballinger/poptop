Announcement

To: poptop-server@lists.sourceforge.net
Subject: pptpd-1.3.0 released

G'day,

pptpd 1.3.0 has been released.  This is a development release that
contains some privately tested modifications to prevent a loopback
problem on slow systems using kernel 2.6.x, an apparently working
packet reordering feature, an untested logwtmp plugin option to strip
the domain name from usernames when they are added to wtmp, a fix to
processing of the initial packet header, ignore certain additional
common failures of bcrelay, and a few documentation fixes.

Please reply to the mailing list with your test results.
