+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|20030128   | -     | <= 1.1.3 |         | Make the logentries more verbose, so that they actually    |
|           |       |          |         | mean something to the admins.	                      |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|20021220   | -     | <= 1.1.3 |         | Add a way to define pools for different usergroups.	      |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|20021206   | =     | <= 1.1.3 | 1.1.4   | pptpctrl leaves pppd running.  PPTP daemon's pptpctrl      |
|           |       |          |         | process exit()s when Stop-Control-Connection-Request is    |
|           |       |          |         | received or when a signal is received. It doesn't take     |
|           |       |          |         | care of the spawned pppd process.	                      |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|20021205   | *     | <= 1.1.3 | 1.1.4   | call ID 0 is allocated on all TCP links.                   |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|20021204   | *     | <= 1.1.3 | 1.1.4   | ip-up child of pppd becomes zombie.	                      |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|19990802   | -	    | <= 1.1.3 |         | We don't actually implement any kind of window protocol,   |
|	    |	    |          |         | congestion control, etc, etc.  Very simple algorithm which |
|	    |	    |          |         | works well on LANs and good performance links but could be |
|	    |	    |          |         | improved for slow distant dialups/bad routing and links.   |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|19990705   | =	    | <= 1.1.3 | 1.1.4   | Disconnection generates ugly error messages with most      |
|	    |	    |          |         | clients - although we follow the draft properly.           |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|19990705   | -     | <= 1.1.3 |         | PNS mode and all things which go with it aren't supported  |
|	    |	    |          |         | properly.  We're only an IP tunnelling PAC, and our        |
|	    |	    |          |         | clients act as a PNS, as per the draft.  We may implement  |
|	    |	    |          |         | PNS mode and related things like multiple calls from one   |
|	    |	    |          |         | client IP in the future (post-1.0).	 		      |
+-----------+-------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|19990413   | -	    | <= 1.1.3 |         | SET LINK INFO (CTRL Message 15) is not fully implemented.  |
|	    |	    |          |         | This doesn't cause any problem with Win95/98/NT or Linux   |
|	    |	    |          |         | clients.  NT clients send a default set of ACCMs which we  |
|      	    |       |          |         | validate and ignore, the others don't send anything.       |
|	    |	    |          |         | Probably fine for all IP tunneling clients (post-1.0).     |
