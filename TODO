20040521-4, 1.2.0-b3, running on Fedora Core 1, kernel ? , when a
connection arrives a warning is issued by the kernel "application bug:
pptpctrl($PID) has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN but calls wait().  (see the
NOTES section of 'man 2 wait').  Workaround activated."

20040521-3, 1.2.0-b3, possible related to 20040521-1, connection to a
busy pptpd host shows many packets from the client being echoed back
unprocessed, until the first packet emitted by pppd.

20040521-2, 1.2.0-b3, with ppp 2.4.2, pptpd reports "GRE: Bad checksum
from pppd" once or twice.

20040521-1, 1.2.0-b3, on particularly slow pptpd systems (such as the
maintainer's lab hosts) some race-like situation occurs after
openpty(), pppd fails with "Failed to open /dev/pts/0: No such file or
directory", and the remote client receives every packet back, quickly
detecting "Serial line is looped back."  Subsequent connection
attempts work fine.  Can be reproduced on a 266MHz Pentium II if
memory is first purged with "dd < /dev/zero > tmp".

20040521-0, 1.2.0-b3, write bcrelay man page.  (Debian lintian for
pptpd 1.1.4-0b4-1)

feature: nuke prior login by user, using pppd plugin.

feature: prevent login by user if prior login still in progress, using
pppd plugin that captures old hook and re-uses it, during chap auth.

20040428-7, CVS HEAD, minor, pptpctrl.c refers to hard coded path
/usr/lib/pptpd/pptpd-logwtmp.so instead of path derived from prefix
given to configure script.

20040428-0, important, bcrelay failure, >bcrelay[357]: mainloop:
Error, sendto failed! (rv=-1, errno=6), per mailing list thread.

20040426-0 bug: terminating immediately on CALL_CLR_RQST from client
(1.2.0-b3) may violate the RFC, but was done to fix zombie pppd, Bruno
will try older version to gather system state information to see why
it happened, but there is indeed a design defect that doesn't reap
(wait() on the PID of) the pppd it had previously forked.  it probably
isn't right to simply kill() the pppd until it has had a chance to
finish up, e.g. ip-down scripts.  context is pptpctrl.c.  on the other
hand, if a stop control connection request arrives, are the active
connections supposed to be closed; there are reports of pppd living
on.

minor bug: pptpctrl.c:302 (1.11) there is a test for absolute file
descriptor numbers, which is probably not portable.

bug: 1.2.0-b3 configfile.c opens, reads and closes /etc/pptpd.conf as
many times as there are possible option values, and only returns the
first match for a keyword, not the last.
